-okay, so the best way to do this would be to somehow integrate with google claendar
	-we are probably going to have to do this using api calls to be honest
	-the issue with this is that we are going to have to create our own calendar, then issue an add or edit to google calendar everytime that happens
	-also, it might be an issue to authenticate with Google Calendar. this would involve sending out requests with c++
	-yeah as much as I want to experience making a c++ app like htis, python might be the best way to do this.
	-oh wait, it supports the .net framework...oh, for c sharp....hmmmm. this is tough. because we can make this in c#. that might actually be a good mix
	-that would align more with my goals, but I am not suer how to make cross platofrm c#.
-okay, so what are we going to do next...I guess I should ugh, pick a languge and start fucking going I guess.
-python will probably be best to be honest. what I really need to do is make sure that I can run it on my windows 10 machine too.
-so lets just make one and see
-so we are going to do this online...also so we can fix problems and update as needed
-so we do need to figure out the apis and everything. so what info do we need to get. we need to get this info fresh in our heads again
-right so I hate to admit it,but I am going to need to figure out the google caledanr integration first
-getting that module to work will be the first thing that we have to do....and i need to make sure that we get the events back when they are changed and stuff.
-I need to create a module that will automatically create an event, in a google calendar window....but so I even need to store that info????
-no google calendar is our backend database. heres how it will work....we will issue create commands from our module and front end, and we will show the 
google calendar on our frontend as well. whenever we want to find out metrics on an individual we will just query google calendar. 
-so essentially google calendar is our database. and we will only issue create commands to it....but the trick will be forcing the user to create events
through our interface, and not that of Google Calendar.
-I will basically need to give him a new calendar, and have him transition over
-this is perfect. the embedded calendar is read only anyways. so to add an event in the mainpage the user will be forced to go through
our module. to delete an event they will have to go to google calendar, and to get metrics we will query google calendar.
-for this we will want to create a module that will handle all of this for us. getting information on events is important. 
	-getEvents
-I bet that I can keep a list of event ids locally, and that can help me with my update from Google calendar. it will be hard to keep 
this in exact sync with google calendar though. but I do not see an api that lets me select a range of dates to get from
-so we will not have to keep track of the events, we can set max and min date parameters
-so we know this is possible, but we do need to get this running in python
-so it looks like I just need a client_secrets.json file and I will be good, which is pretty fortunate
-okay, what else. we need to build out the module that will assist us in grabbing all these events
-alright, what is next. we need to figure out how to pass along the name.
-well it comes in in the url....the template...as an argument
-the only thing I can think of is to scan the url to find it

-okay, so we need to figure out why we have insufficient permissions
-okay, so we are still getting these insufficient permissions and it is because that api is not allowed since we do not have a verified app

-for right now we are just going to role with this
-okay cool, so we can add calednar events. I have figured that out
-so, just as a fun thing lets figure out how to do the searches in the main menu, so vue search
-cool, we have filter working too
-so the next thing is to pull metrics. the first part of this was going to be pulling all the events from google calendar
-hmmmmm okay so I think we got what we needed figuring this out
-so we are going to have to think about how in javascript we are going to be able to request this type of data. so we can call a method that requests
this shit...on page load we will send off that request
-right so on page load we will always need to load metrics. so when we load these metrics if we have a name we can send that in the request, if there is 
no name then we will fetch all.
-so I guess the first step is going to be that we need to figure out how to request this stuff from my server. what 
-hmmm, the issue is going to be sending the name. the issue is we are using the same function for the main page and for the knights. so how are we going to 
pull the name???

-right so we know the name is going to be the hardest part, vue needs to know what name we are on....so we can get that from the url, or what else???? because I 
am tired of getting it from the fucking url. when we render that html can we basically save that name....no that is going to be in python....the only way that we know 
the name is because it is in the javascript. lets try to see if we can change the path url. in that way we can include arguments in the url....and this will be easier

-okay so what is next. I do want a better calendar, but I should put this thing online so that Hector can actually get to it
-yeah the next thing that I have to do is actually deploy it on my servers

-so I am just going to go all in and try to deploy to the server. no transition that I will be trying to do
-so I do need to figure out how I am going to be able to connect to the django socket and everything. I might have to burn through a few tutorialsx`x`



IDEAS
_______________________________________________________
-program will load and save a file that will have all of this information.
	-in this way we won't have to worry about the program pulling data from a server or a computer crashing and losing all data
	-the responsibility of keeping that file safe will be on the user
-dont want to make too complex, but it would be nice to integrate with current invoicing




TODO
_______________________________________________________
-apis
	-our server
		-getPredictedIncome
			-parameters: # dates into future, name of knight (if none return aggregate of all)
			-returns: predicted income for time frame based on # of meetings scheduled
		-addKnight
			-parameters: name of knight
			-returns: whether it was successful or not
		-deleteKnight
			-parameters: name of knight
			-returns: whether deletion really worked
	-google calendar
		-getNumFutureMeetings
			-parameters: # dates into future
			-returns: json data of all the future meeting calednar events
		-addFutureMeeting
			-parameters: json of event details



-need to create landing page that will allow us to save user's google key (like postman did. we signed in with Google)
-make sure that the height of our columns stay within the bounds of the window. we do not want to scroll to see these items
-figure out why we have a horizontal scroll at the bottom....no matter what we seem to do
-make sure that modal closes after we submit it
-add meeting length
-figure out a way to serve token.pickle request page to the user
-make sure our timezones change appropriatly
-restructure our models so that we have a google calendar class that we call, instead of all of these methods
-pull in the timezone from the user and adjust the clock for that
-move timezone factor into a constants file (like extratime in models.py)



QUESTIONS
_______________________________________________________
-how do you manage google calendar events through the PhoneBurner software?
	-ideally the Scorecard program could just pull in google calendar events instead of you having to enter this data manually. However, I need to know more about how integrated your PhoneBurner software is with Google Calendar
-Do you have any idea of how you want to predict future earnings?
	-Based on future calendar meetings
	-(average earnings of each agent per day) * (number of agents) * (number of days)
	-some other correlation between time, number of agents, past meeting numbers
-Are there any other agent statistics you would like to track besides number of meetings?
	-maybe user rating of client or other data you collect on them
-Are there any meetings that you set up outside of the Eastern time zone
-what are the lengths of the meeting?
-what kind of info do you need from clients
-would you want calendar events to be sent out to clients as well?

ANSWERED
_______________________________________________________
-how would you feel about a software program compared to an excel spreadsheet

-what utilities are you currently working with? – Yes very open to outside conventional wisdom.

                -keep track of information – My current CRM Program keeps reports, reports then are matched with Google Calendar and affirmed that there was an appointment and should be billed at the end of the month.

                -receive payments – Paypal

                -send out invoices – Via Paypal

                -Calendar?: I believe you mentioned google calendar – Google Calendar very user friendly and calendar sharing is excellent and interfaces with Outlook

-how many individual field agents are you tracking? – 30 Agents and growing.

-do you need to keep track of the members that they are seeing? – Yes, my currently program Phone Burner accomplishes a lot of the CRM needed to maintain keeping track of KC Members and the results of our phone discussions.

                -information on the members such as name, phone number, etc... Phone Burner accomplishes this currently for us.

-do you need to track statistics per agent? – Yes, statistics would be very appealing…currently not doing this.

                -meetings they had – Yes, I’m very open to this feature. Statistics will allow us to continue to sell our service to other agents. As well, assist in our exit strategy and we continue to build this business to sell.

                -what came of the meetings – Yes.

                -etc...

-would you like a visual representation of the number of meetings each agent had over time?

-such as a line graph – Yes, sounds sophisticated and interesting.

-assume you want to be able to view the scorecard from days/weeks/months years in the past correct? – Yes.

-is there a team that you work with? – No team currently just myself and 1 associate.

                -how do you divide clients -  I call for all the clients.

-Do you care about logging when the meetings take place, or whether they actually occurred – We confirm every appointment the day prior and that has served as confirmation that the actual appointment occurred or will occur and is then deemed billable.

-Do you want the scorecard to make predictions about how much you will earn in the future based on the values of the past? – Yes.
